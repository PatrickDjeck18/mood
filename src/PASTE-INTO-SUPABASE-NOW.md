## üîç **HOW TO FIND THE FILE**

**In your Figma Make file tree:**
```
üìÅ /
  üìÑ COMBINED-BACKEND-INDEX.ts  <-- THIS ONE!
  üìÑ PASTE-INTO-SUPABASE-NOW.md <-- This guide
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **DO NOT** modify the file - paste it exactly as-is
2. **DO NOT** change the route prefix `/make-server-4bcc747c`
3. **Make sure** you're pasting into the `make-server-4bcc747c` function
4. **The file is ~1400 lines** - this is normal and correct

## üÜò **IF YOU GET STUCK**

**Problem:** Can't find the file?
- **Solution:** Look in the root directory `/` for `COMBINED-BACKEND-INDEX.ts`

**Problem:** Deployment failed?
- **Solution:** Make sure you deleted ALL the old code before pasting

**Problem:** Code looks different?
- **Solution:** That's OK! The Supabase editor reformats it automatically

---

## ‚úÖ **AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

Once deployed, your backend will:
- ‚úÖ Accept user signups
- ‚úÖ Send welcome emails
- ‚úÖ Store user data in KV store
- ‚úÖ Provide admin stats
