# üîß Fix Email Service Issue - Invalid API Key

## üö® The Problem

Your admin dashboard is showing:
```
üîë Email Service Issue: Invalid API Key
Failed to fetch
```

This means your **RESEND_API_KEY** is either:
- ‚ùå Invalid format (doesn't start with `re_`)
- ‚ùå Expired or revoked
- ‚ùå Not set properly in Supabase
- ‚ùå Network issue connecting to Resend

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Get a New Resend API Key

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**
   ```
   https://resend.com/api-keys
   ```

2. **Login to your Resend account**
   - Use your Resend credentials
   - If you don't have an account, create one at https://resend.com/signup

3. **Create a New API Key**
   - Click "Create API Key" button
   - **Name**: "MingleMood Production" (or any name)
   - **Permission**: Select "Full Access" or "Sending Access"
   - Click "Create"

4. **Copy the API Key**
   - The key will look like: `re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy it immediately - you won't see it again!
   - It should start with `re_`
   
   Example format:
   ```
   re_123ABC456DEF789GHI012JKL345MNO
   ```

### Step 2: Update Supabase Environment Variable

   ```

2. **Navigate to Edge Functions Settings**
   - Click on "Edge Functions" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Settings" or "Secrets"
   - Or go directly to:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/functions
   ```

   - Make sure it starts with `re_`
   - **No spaces before or after**
   
   ```
   Name: RESEND_API_KEY
   Value: re_123ABC456DEF789GHI012JKL345MNO
   ```

5. **Save the Secret**
   - Click "Save" or "Update"
   - Wait for confirmation

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Edge Function (CRITICAL!)

**IMPORTANT**: Updating the secret is NOT enough! You must redeploy.

1. Go to Edge Functions in Supabase Dashboard
2. Find the `make-server-4bcc747c` function
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"

#### Option B: Using Command Line

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy make-server-4bcc747c
```

   Name: @
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: _dmarc
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   ```

5. **Wait for Verification**
   - DNS changes can take 5-60 minutes
   - Resend will show "Verified" when ready
   - You can click "Verify" to check status
